## Intro
Hey, I'm going to put all my python projects here. 
If you have any problems or ideas for changes, I suggest you open a ticket and let me know.


## Cryptography
In this part I will put all the scripts related to cryptography. There will be two distinct parts to this section. 
One will be dedicated to historical algorithms (the César cipher, Vigénère cipher, Hill cipher, etc.). 
The second will be devoted to algorithms that I have personally developed.


## Game
This part will be dedicated to games that I have recoded in python. Please note, for certain games you will need to install Tkinter

## Misc
I will put in this part all the small scripts that I develop, and which help me in some of my scripts.

## CTF
I will put in this part all the python scripts that can help during CTF/hackathon
